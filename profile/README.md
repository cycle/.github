#### 🗺️ The Cycle ecosystem contains the following packages:

- [**Database**](https://github.com/cycle/database): contains a set of database connectors and utilities
  for working with different database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and SQLite.
- [**ORM**](https://github.com/cycle/orm): provides the data mapper layer.
- [**Annotated**](https://github.com/cycle/annotated): provides support for annotated/attributed entity classes,
  which allow you to define your Database and ORM schemas directly in your PHP code.
- [**Schema Renderer**](https://github.com/cycle/schema-renderer): allows to render an ORM schema into different
  formats, such as PHP code, console output, and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/).
- [**Entity Behavior**](https://github.com/cycle/entity-behavior): a bunch of utility classes that
  you can use to add some handy behaviors to your entities, e.g. to easily implement soft deleting,
  optimistic lock, auto timestamps, and [automatic UUID generation](https://cycle-orm.dev/docs/entity-behaviors-uuid)
- [**Migrations**](https://github.com/cycle/migrations): automatically generates migration files based on
  the difference between the annotated ORM schema and the current database schema.
  This helps you ensure that the database schema stays in sync with the ORM schema.
